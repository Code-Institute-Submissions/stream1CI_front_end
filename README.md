# Code Institute Stream 1 project
Front end based portfolio page

##The header
The image used in the header is fully responsive and with CSS3 and jQuery i was able to make it fullscreen on all devices.
I used Bootstrap to make a responsive navbar,which on small devices collapses into a icon.
Also with jQuery i made smooth scrolling available if the user click on a navbar item

##The portfolio section
The page also use Bootstrap to achieve full responsiveness.
The chosen font is linked from google fonts.
The colours palett was generated on www.coolors.co so the div and font colours adjust to the header image.
2 type of sliders are available on the page what can grab the user`s attention:
-On medium and large devices a customized 3D carousel from www.codepen.io
-On small devices a bootstrap slider.

###The gallery with Flickr API
The page uses the Flickr API to pull images from a Flickr gallery.
A certain number of images are generated, then on click Javascript will copy the source of the choosen image and paste it to a larger div.
To make sure that the user knows that this gallery is functional, the cursor will change into a pointer and the small images
will loose some opacity.

##The about me section
This section uses CSS3 to achieve parralax scrolling. As the user scroll down the pictures will change as the text div`s passing through.

##The contact section
This section uses Font awesome icons.
The icons uses font-awesome-animation.css for the hover animation for a great user experience.
